These dotfiles have been built with patience the last few months, they are not perfect by no means but they work great for my use case. I have been inspired by catppuccin macchiato color theme and my favorite band.

I mainly use hyprland as a DE but I have XFCE as a backup, but I may move to KDE for the backup later.

The choice to moving from Arch to NixOS was made after running into recurrent troubles with hardware and it was a good choice. NixOS has a learning curve but once you learn the basis it's a pleasure to use this OS for a everyday use.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the apps I use :
- hyprpaper
- hyprlock
- kitty
- fish
- starship
- rofi
- waybar
- swaync
- fastfetch
- waypaper
- tailscale
- joplin
- nextcloud
- nixvim
- spicetify
- finamp
- plexamp
- zen browser

For the few ones insterested, here are some screenshots
